    <h2>Trading Risk</h2>
    <p>
      Trading financial markets involves significant risk and may not be

      decisions may result in losses.
    </p>

    <h2>System Development and Testing</h2>
    <p>
      MilkrFX trading systems are developed using rule-based methodologies and
      are evaluated through historical data analysis, backtesting, and controlled
      testing environments to assess behavior under varying market conditions.
      Historical testing is used for evaluation purposes only and does not
      represent future performance.
