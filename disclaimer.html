      <h1>Risk Disclaimer</h1>

      <p>
        MilkrFX develops and provides rule-based trading indicators,
        expert advisors, and analytical tools intended to support
        structured market analysis. All products and content are
        provided for informational and educational purposes only.
      </p>

      <h2>Trading Risk</h2>
      <p>
        Trading in financial markets involves risk and may not be
        suitable for all individuals. Market prices can fluctuate
        rapidly, and trading decisions may result in financial loss.
      </p>

      <h2>System Development and Evaluation</h2>
      <p>
        MilkrFX systems are developed using predefined, rule-based
        methodologies and are evaluated through historical data
        analysis, backtesting, and controlled testing environments.
        Historical testing is used solely for evaluation purposes and
        does not indicate or guarantee future performance.
      </p>

      <h2>No Investment or Financial Advice</h2>
      <p>
        MilkrFX does not provide investment advice, financial advice,
        or personalized trading recommendations. Users are solely
        responsible for their own trading decisions, risk management,
        and capital allocation.
      </p>

      <h2>Use of Software and Tools</h2>
      <p>
        Trading software, indicators, and expert advisors are provided
        as tools to assist with analysis and execution. Market
        conditions vary, and no trading system can ensure specific
        outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2>User Responsibility</h2>
      <p>
        Users are responsible for understanding the risks associated
        with trading and for ensuring compliance with all applicable
        laws and regulations within their jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        MilkrFX shall not be held liable for any losses, damages, or
        claims arising from the use or misuse of its software, tools,
        or website content.
